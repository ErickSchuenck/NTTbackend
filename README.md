# NTTbackend
NTTDataMovieReviewer is a project made for NTT Data where you can get information about released movies. In this project, I used the following technologies in the frontend: React, Redux, and Sass.

Warning: The frontend of this project runs on http://localhost:3000/, while the backend runs on http://localhost:5000/, so please avoid port conflicts.

Getting Started
Clone the following repositories:

Frontend: https://github.com/ErickSchuenck/NTTDataMovieReviewer.git
Backend: https://github.com/ErickSchuenck/NTTbackend.git
Use the npm i command on the terminal to install dependencies, and npm start to initiate both front and backend.

How to Use
Type the name of the movie you want to get information about in the search bar and click the search button. The default movie is Whiplash, which is my favorite movie. ðŸ˜‰

Restrictions
Since this project uses the OMDb API, usage is restricted to 1000 requests/day.
